# GrouponScraper
This project was used to help manage the store I worked at called Unifix Repairs. We repair electronic devices and used Groupon to further reach more customers. Since Groupon is separate from Unifix Repairs when a customer purchased a repair through Groupon, we would have to manually add their code when we received their item, and manually redeem it after the customer left with the device. While simple, this posed a problem as it was possible to forget to redeem codes and the only way to check if codes remained was to manually check every code within a selected time.

# So what does this do?
This was used to simply monitor our ticket system and closely monitor tickets that were marked for $0 or specifically labeled a Groupon ticket. When our system showed the device as checked out, the program shows the ticket visually with a small UI built in Tkinter. It also exports relevant data to an Excel file per the owner's request.
